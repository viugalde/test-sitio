I loved creating spaces that made sense. But my life transitioned; I moved to Vancouver, Canada, to study for an MBA, finishing in Fall 2025.\n\nFor me, it‚Äôs been a huge step so far, not just for my career, but because of who I‚Äôm becoming. I‚Äôm figuring out how to bring that same creative mindset into the world of business. It‚Äôs like blending two lives into one. And maybe this sounds like a huge challenge or roadblock, but for me it is my passion; I see it as a world of new possibilities.\n\nIn parallel, I co-founded a new startup, a consulting firm based in British Columbia: BusinessBear. The company is focused on providing affordable, personalized services for small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\nSo, I no longer just build and design physical spaces. Now I also sculpt and craft new business ideas, implement strategies, and redefine processes.\n\nThat‚Äôs the kind of legacy I want to help build.\n\n---\n\n## Education\n\n**Master in Business Administration (MBA)** *(in progress)*  \nUniversity Canada West ‚Äî Vancouver, Canada  \nJan 2024 ‚Äì Sep 2025  \nAreas of Interest: Strategy, Consulting, and Sustainability\n\n**Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Architecture & Urban Design** *(Graduated with Honors)*  \nUniversidad Iberoamericana ‚Äî Mexico City, Mexico (1996)\n\n---\n\n## Work Experience\n\n**Co-Founder & Business Consultant** ‚Äì *BusinessBear*, British Columbia (2025‚ÄìPresent)  \nFocused on advising small businesses and entrepreneurs with strategic advice in planning, branding, and operations challenges.\n\n**Seasonal Educator** ‚Äì *Lululemon*, Coquitlam (2024‚Äì2025)  \nGuest services, mentoring, retail sales, and operations.\n\n**Operations Coordinator & Business Co-Founder** ‚Äì *Concepto 25*, Cuernavaca (2018‚Äì2023)  \nLed day-to-day operations, finance, strategy, sales, HR, process improvement, and client experience like Walmart.\n\n**Senior Associate Corporate Accounts** ‚Äì *CBRE*, Mexico City (2012‚Äì2018)  \nLed cross-functional teams of Fortune 500 companies in Latin America.
